This directory contains documentation for the variables in the OneStop dataset. The dataset contains two types of variables: [data variables](data_variables.md) and [metadata variables](metadata_variables.md). Data variables are the variables that are collected from the participants, and metadata variables are the variables that are collected from the metadata of the participants.
