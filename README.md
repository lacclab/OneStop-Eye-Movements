# OneStop: A 360-Participant Eye-Tracking Dataset for Reading Comprehension, Readability and Re-Reading in Ordinary and Information-Seeking Reading

We present OneStop, a corpus of eye movements in reading, in which native (L1) English speakers read texts in English from the Guardian and answer reading comprehension questions about them.

OneStop is the largest English eye-tracking dataset with L1 speakers to date, comprising eye movement recordings from 360 participants over 2.6 million word tokens. 

The experiment is conducted using extensively piloted reading comprehension materials with 486 multiple choice reading comprehension questions and auxiliary text annotations geared towards behavioral analyses of reading comprehension. 

OneStopGaze further includes controlled experimental manipulations of the difficulty level of the text, the presented questions, first reading versus re-reading, and ordinary reading versus information seeking. 
<!--- The broad coverage and controlled experimental design of OneStopGaze aim to enable new research avenues in the cognitive study of reading and human language processing, and provide new possibilities for the integration of psycholinguistics with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). --->
